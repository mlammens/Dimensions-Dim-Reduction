Dimensions ZA - New data for dimensions-reduction paper
===============================

This folder includes the data for Protea that extends beyond the extent used in the American Naturalist paper, that is, beyond the extent of the fynbos layer used in Adam Wilson's interpolated climate dataset.

Protea_Site_Data.csv--includes site names, GPS, field-site data, and soil data where available for 2011-2014 (note that 2014 samples were used only for DNA collection, not trait or envi). Can be used to extract climate data from Adam and Schulze layers.

Protea_Trait_Data.csv--includes all trait observations from 2011-2013, raw and derived variables. Recommend merging site and trait data using "Site_name".

To do:
-add isotope data to trait file (when available)
-
