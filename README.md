Dimensions ZA - Application of Curtis and Ghosh 2011 to Dimensions Data
===============================

This repository includes an R script and JAGS model file to run the methods 
presented in the following publication
(Curtis and Ghosh. 2011. A bayesian approach to multicolllinearity
and the simultaneous selection and clustering of predictors in linear 
regression. *Journal of Statistical Theory and Practice* 5(4): 715-735.)
on the Dimensions ZA data.

To-Do
====
* Re-read paper an formulate questions for Sujit and Xiaojing
* We need to determine how the clustering of regression coefficients is
carried out. This may require contacting the authors as well.
	* Also look into possibility of using phylogenetic methods,
	particularly majority rule consensus trees, to get clustering.
* Determine how to include categorical and factor variables.
* Advance this to a multi-response model.
