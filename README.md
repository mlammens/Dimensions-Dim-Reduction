===============================

This repository includes an R script and JAGS model file to run the methods 
presented in the following publication
(Curtis and Ghosh. 2011. A bayesian approach to multicolllinearity
and the simulatneous selection and clustering of predictors in linear

* Re-read paper an forumlate questions for Sujit and Xiaojing
